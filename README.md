# MCTS Algorithm Demonstration

## 1. System Requirements

- **Python version:** 3.9.6
- **Dependencies:** No external packages required; the code runs with standard Python libraries only.
- **Operating System:** Tested on macOS and Ubuntu 20.04.
- **Hardware:** No special hardware required.

## 2. Installation Guide

No additional installation is necessary. Simply ensure Python 3.9.6 is available on your system.

**Estimated installation time:** Less than 1 minute on a standard desktop computer.

## 3. Demonstration and Output

Due to enterprise confidentiality and intellectual property policies, both the input parcel-sorting data and the source code for PSDTS are proprietary assets of the SF Express and must be protected to ensure privacy and data security Therefore, a typical algorithm output is provided as a text file (`output.txt`) for reference. This output demonstrates the major results and execution process of the DT-SMCTS algorithm implementation.

**Sample output (see `output.txt` for the complete file):**
standard_rollout_input:{…}

平均产能(Average Throughput): 16293.26
峰值产能(Peak Throughput): 18252
Final Results: 16880.88
Best value: 16880.88

## 4. Instructions for Use

To execute the DT-SMCTS algorithm, run the provided Python script (DT-SMCTS.py) in your local Python 3.9.6 environment. For users who do not have access to the proprietary and privacy-sensitive digital_twin module, it is possible to implement and substitute a custom performance evaluation function as needed.
